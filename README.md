#Humor

Anyone know the strange relief when you refactor 308 lines of code? No, that's just me. Ok then.

Who likes boolean logic? Not me. Especially simple statements such as `turn and isPointInVector(...)`

"Wait... why am I able to move this... (the king will be in check) ... Oh. Why does this king say it didn't move \**sigh*\*"

Ok, how does stalemate not work, but checkmate works perfectly fine?

All checks are checkmates. Yes that's my new rule.
